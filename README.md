# eBookShelf Android App

Now everyone in the modern society always has a smart phone with themselves. Also, the worldâ€™s most popular mobile platform is Android. Therefore, more and more people read e-books on their smartphones. I decided to create an e-book reader on Android platform. In this app, I use several Android techniques to complete this e-book shelf app such as Fragment, Service, AsyncTask, SQLite Database, Google Map API, and so on.
